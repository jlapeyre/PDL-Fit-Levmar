This module contains a PDL (Perl Data Language) interface to
the levmar library. The levmar library contains
Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routines (by Manolis
Lourakis). Levmar provides a single entry point to twelve
routines in the library (plus some utility routines). These
routines offer: fitting with numerical or analytic
jacobians; single or double precision; no constraints, or
linear constraints, or box constraints.

See INSTALL for instructions on building and installing and
dependencies on external libraries. In brief, you need only
a standard PDL installation and lapack and blas shared
libraries and headers.
