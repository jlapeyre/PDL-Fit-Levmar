Dependencies:

Linearly-constrained fitting requires the lapack and blas libraries.
But, unconstrained and box constraints do not require lapack.
See INSTALL for more information.

There are many ways to provide lapack, even on the same platform.

The following shared libraries or equivalents are required (version numbers are
those used for testing this module.)
liblapack.so.3
libblas.so.3
libg2c.so.0

Linking against these shared libaries requires, for instance under debian, that
the following development packages be installed.

lapack3-dev library of linear algebra routines 3 - static library
refblas3-dev   Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines 3, static library

# The following is a dependency of lapack3-dev, and refblas3-dev
(libg2c0-dev GNU Fortran 77 library development)

These libraries are used in building the upstream levmar library. There
are other options for providing the lapack and blas routines. If you
use these other libraries, you have to edit Makefile.PL
